# GREED
Simple, yet satisfying-- get greedy and gather as many gems as you can, BUT watch out for those rocks!!!  

Each gem is worth 1 point, while each rock will take away 1 point.

It's all yours for the taking so start NOW!!!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3  
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
